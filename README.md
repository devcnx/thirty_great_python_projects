## Project 1: Mad Libs Game
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Mad Libs game is an interactive game that challenges players to provide various types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to complete a story template. The game uses these words to generate a humorous and nonsensical story.

The game begins by displaying a series of prompts to the user, asking for specific types of words. After collecting all the necessary words, the game substitutes them into a pre-defined story template, creating a unique and (sometimes) funny story based on the user's input.

**Key Learning Points**
- Handling user inputs dynamically. 
- Using string formatting techniques to insert user inputs into a template. 
- Basic game flow and logic. 

**Completed on**: Sunday, July 14th, 2024  

## Project 2: Number Guessing Game
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Number Guessing Game is a simple game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between a specified range (1 to 100). The player is given feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or exhausts the maximum number of guesses. 

The game also includes features to handle invalid inputs and provides and option for the player to play again after each game session. 

**Key Learning Points**
- Implementing input validation. 
- Using random number generation.
- Handling game flow and logic for a guessing game.

**Completed on**: Sunday, July 14th, 2024  

## Project 3: Dice Simulator
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Dice Simulator allows the user to roll a specified number of dice and get random results for each roll. For each roll, the total (sum) of the dice are displayed to the user. This simulation mimics the rolls of physical dice, providing practice working with random numbers and user input.

**Key Learning Points**
- Generating random numbers.
- Handling user inputs and validation.
- Creating a loop for continuous user interaction.

**Completed on**: Monday, July 15th, 2024 

## Project 4: Hangman Game
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess the letters of a randomly selected word. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. The game displays the word with underscores representing the letters that have not been guessed yet. The player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts and loses if they run out of attempts before guessing the word. 

The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guessed letter is correct or incorrect. Correct guesses reveal the position of the letter in the word, while incorrect guesses reduce the number of attempts remaining. The game ends when the player wins or loses, and the final result is displayed. The player can choose to play again or exit the game.

**Key Learning Points**
- Implementing word-guessing game logic. 
- Handling user inputs and validation. 
- Managing game state and user feedback.

**Completed on**: Monday, July 15th, 2024

## Project 5: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic hand game played between two people. The player competes against the computer by choosing one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer also randomly selects one of the three choices. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

The game provides feedback on the outcome of each round and allows the player to play multiple rounds.

**Key Learning Points**
- Implementing game logic for Rock, Paper, Scissors.
- Handling user inputs and validation.
- Generating random choices for the computer.

**Completed on**: Wednesday, July 17th, 2024 

## Project 6: Password Generator
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Password Generator module generates random passwords for the user. It allows the user to generate between (1) and (5) passwords at a time, with each password being between (8) and (15) characters. The module ensures that the generated passwords contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 

**Key Learning Points**
- Generating random passwords with a mix of character types.
- Validating user input for the number of passwords and their length. 
- Ensuring validated passwords meet common security requirements. 

**Completed on**: Wednesday, July 17th, 2024 

## Project 7: QR Code Generator
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The QR Code Generator application allows users to generate QR codes for any input text or URL. The generated QR codes can be saved as image files (PNG) for later use. This project demonstrates how to work with external libraries in Python to create and manipulate images.

**Key Learning Points**
- Generating QR codes using Python libraries. 
- Handling user inputs and validations. 
- Saving generated QR codes as image files. 

**Completed on**: Sunday, July 21st, 2024

## Project 8: Website Checker
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Website Checker application allows users to check the status of websites. The user can enter a list of websites in a CSV file, and the website checker will check the status of each website and print the results to the console. This project demonstrates how to work with external libraries in Python to: create and manipulate files, read and write CSV files, and send HTTP requests. 

**Key Learning Points**
- Checking website status using Python libraries. 
- Reading from CSV files. 
- Sending HTTP requests. 

**Completed on**: Sunday, July 21st, 2024

## Project 9: Password Checker
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Password Checker application allows users to check if their password is considered a common password. The user can enter a password and the application will tell the user if the password is considered common based on if it's located in a list of common passwords. This project demonstrates working with reading files (.txt) in Python and working with user inputs and validations. 

**Key Learning Points**
- Checking if a password is common against a list of common passwords. 
- Handling user inputs and validations.
- Reading from files.

**Completed on**: Monday, July 22nd, 2024

## Project 10: Brute Force
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Brute Force application is used to crack passwords. This application is for educational purposes only. The project demonstrates working with reading files (.txt), working with the itertools library, and threads to run the application in parallel. 

**Key Learning Points**
- Generating all possible combinations of characters using the itertools library. 
- Scrambling characters to generate random words. 
- Checking for common matches in a list of words. 
- Implementing brute force login to crack passwords. 
- Using threading to run multiple brute force attempts in parallel. 
- Calculating potential number of combinations for tracking progress. 

**Completed on**: Sunday, July 28th, 2024

## Project 11: Image Downloader
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### Description

The Image Downloader application is used to download images. The project demonstrates how to work with the requests library and validate user inputs (image URLs). 

**Key Learning Points**
- Making HTTP GET requests. 
- Handling user inputs and validations. 
- Saving downloaded images to a directory.
