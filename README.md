## Project 1: Mad Libs Game

### Description

The Mad Libs game is an interactive game that challenges players to provide various types of words
(nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to complete a story template. The game uses these words to generate
a humorous and nonsensical story.

The game begins by displaying a series of prompts to the user, asking for specific types of words. 
After collecting all the necessary words, the game substitutes them into a pre-defined story 
template, creating a unique and (sometimes) funny story based on the user's input.


**Key Learning Points**
- Handling user inputs dynamically. 
- Using string formatting techniques to insert user inputs into a template. 
- Basic game flow and logic. 

### Technologies
- Python

### Installation 
1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/devcnx/thirty_great_python_projects.git
    cd thirty_great_python_projects/mad_libs
    ```
2. Install required dependencies (if applicable):
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the project:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py
    ```

### Usage
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter various types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.). 
The game will display a story using the words you provided. 

### Features
- Interactive word prompts. 
- Multiple story templates. 
- Dynamic word replacement.
- User-friendly interface.

## Project 2: Number Guessing Game

### Description

The Number Guessing Game is a simple game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number
between a specified range (1 to 100). The player is given feedback on whether their guess is too high, 
too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number or exhausts the
maximum number of guesses. 

The game also includes features to handle invalid inputs and provides and option for the player to 
play again after each game session. 

**Key Learning Points**
- Implementing input validation. 
- Using random number generation.
- Handling game flow and logic for a guessing game.

### Technologies
- Python

### Installation 
1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/devcnx/thirty_great_python_projects.git
    cd thirty_great_python_projects/number_guess
    ```
2. Install required dependencies (if applicable):
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the project:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py
    ```

### Usage
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your guesses. The game will provide feedback after each guess
and indicate whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. 

### Features
- Random number generation within a specified range. 
- Input validation for numeric and range constraints. 
- Feedback messages for each guess. 
- Option to play again after winning or losing.  

**Completed on**: Sunday, July 14th, 2024  

## Project 3: Dice Simulator

### Description

The Dice Simulator allows the user to roll a specified number of dice and get random results for each roll. For each roll,
the total (sum) of the dice are displayed to the user. This simulation mimics the rolls of physical dice, providing
practice working with random numbers and user input.

**Key Learning Points**
- Generating random numbers.
- Handling user inputs and validation.
- Creating a loop for continuous user interaction.

### Technologies
- Python

### Installation 
1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/devcnx/thirty_great_python_projects.git
    cd thirty_great_python_projects/dice_simulator
    ```
2. Install required dependencies (if applicable):
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the project:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py
    ```

### Usage
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the number of dice to roll. The game will display the results of the dice
rolls, and the total (sum) of the rolls. Type 'exit' to quit the game.

### Features
- Random dice roll generation.
- User-friendly interface with input validation. 
- Continuous play option.
